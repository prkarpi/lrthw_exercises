# chapter 4 homework

> Verify your Rubocop guard output had no errors, fix them if needed.  Add comments to the Readme.md about how you fixed any issues.

I had several rubocop errors including: long lines, and extra space between lines.
Fixed.

> I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

I am not sure if it is necessary or not, but the numbers without decimal points are called integers, and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point numbers or, more simply, floats. Floats are more accurate.
