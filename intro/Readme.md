> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
  
  The three most important skills that each programmer needs to know are: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

  Reading and writing is essential because without these skills you simply would not be able to apprehend the meaning of any written lines of code.
  
  Attention to detail is important as well since it is the foundation of becoming a good programmer with an eye of an eagle, so to speak;
   
   Spotting the differences is essential to become a proficient programmer; to tell the difference in the written code is an important factor in the software development world.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

  An elementary question, but has a very professional outcome if a student stays away from copying and pasting the code. (I learned it long time ago). By copying and pasting the student takes away privileges of learning anything at all.  

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

  As with any profession or hobby persistence is - paramount. Training your brain to learn and memorize subject matter on the daily basis is - paramount. Not to understand it at first is - a given. To keep doing and not give in is essential in order to become a guru or at least an expert.
